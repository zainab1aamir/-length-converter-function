// Creating a function is a skill that’ll be useful in many settings, and as you progress, you’ll be working on much more complicated functions than this one. But a function that converts units of measure can be pretty handy in multiple professions and industries.

// Let’s start with a conversion from kilometers to miles. The function should include the input in kilometers and return the answer in miles.



function myFunction(){
    let number = prompt("enter the distance in kilometer: ");
    let result = number * 0.621371;
    console.log(result);
    
};

myFunction();
